eCommerce Backend Application
Overview
This project is a fully functional and scalable backend application for an eCommerce platform, built using Java and the Spring Boot framework. It employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and leverages MySQL as the database for managing and storing data. The application provides a set of RESTful APIs that can be easily tested and documented using Postman.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user authentication with JWT, supporting user registration, login, and token-based authorization.
Product Management: CRUD operations for managing the product catalog, allowing administrators to add, update, and remove products.
Order Management: APIs to handle order creation, tracking, and management, enabling users to place and view orders.
Shopping Cart: A complete shopping cart system where users can add products, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout.
MySQL Database Integration: Persistent storage using MySQL with well-structured tables for users, products, orders, and more.
API Documentation: API endpoints are documented and can be tested using a Postman collection.
Technology Stack
Java: The programming language used for the backend application.
Spring Boot: A powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, providing features like dependency injection, security, and more.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for secure authentication and authorization of users.
MySQL: A relational database management system for storing and managing data.
